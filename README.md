# Project name


FoodStories is a Ruby on Rails application that uses OAuth and OmniAuth to login to providers such as Github, Facebook, Google. It help you keep track of your recipes in a single location with features to sort by ingredients, users, or recipe names. The FoodStories app is my third project at the Flatiron School 2020. 

FoodStories allows you to add recipe names, directions for creation, ingredients and quantity and the app keeps an index of other user's recipes as well to choose from.
